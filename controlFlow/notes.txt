statements generally excute from top to bottom in order

control flow stataments break up the flow of execution by employing decision making,
looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks
of code

    decision-making statements:     (if-then, if-then-else, switch, goto)
    looping statements:             (for, while, do-while)
    branching statements:           (break, continue, return)

decision making statements:
    if a condition is true, then a statament/stataments are excuted
    if false, other statements are excuted

loop statament:
    allows us to repeat stataments
    all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed (break and continue)
    becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false
