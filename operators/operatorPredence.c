// Operator precedence
//  determines the grouping of terms and decideds how an expression is evaluated
// Example: mult is higher than addition

/*
    x = 7 + 3 * 2
    could be 13 or 20: depends on the order
    x = 13 as mult goes before the addition
*/

// enclosed in parentheses is executed first
/*
    x = (7 + 3) * 2
    x = 20
*/

// Associativity
//  if they shard an operand, left goes first
/*
    1 == 2 != 3     = true
    (( 1 == 2) != 3)     another way to think about it
    (1 == 2) false ... then .... 0 != 1 ..... equals true
